# PACKETSNIFFERPROTOTYPE

As a beginner i struggle to find project ideas that are interesting for me and.. somewhat portfolio worthy to show what ive been learning and that im ambigious about programming.

To the point :

I have been very interested in cybersecurity and security consepts all together. I started thinking about wireshark, and how interesting all that data about the traffic is,
so thats how i decided on the project. As ive stated pretty clearly im a beginner with about a year of experience in programming, and half of that in c# and dotnet.
Id also like to mention that if you reading this havent somehow read the name of the project, this is a prototype for now as of 11.12.2025, i plan on making this project larger,
easier to maintain, and user-friendly as i go along with the project. I wrote the core logic about 2 months ago buttt... the code was ABSOLUTELE HORROR. So ive decided
to start fresh use proper naming convesions, make the code more readable, make it as industry standardised as i can make a cli app. I also plan on making a gui using wpf or 
winforms once ive got enough experience, or make the app web based. You more experienced programmer might be thinking "Why is this kid using c# for a "low level" networking tool",
and the answer to that is that i have no idea? because its familiar to me but it also shows i have the proper tools to create a project make it easy to maintain and document it.
I have done a lot of research about documenting, formatting and, making code more usable so to speak. with this project i can show that ive got the ability to understand harder,
more difficult concepts about networking and hopefully someone reading this readme understands it.

to the journey : 

i started on opening the above named horrifying source file so i can understand it. I would also like to say i have video footage of me thinking about the project and figuring 
stuff out about it so to speak its in finnish but if someone reads this document in the future and would like me to share the footage, i would be glad.
But anyway id like to continue with the project, even when i have been making this project for a day and wrote 90 lines, i have been gaining a more well rounded experience
about loops, what type of code is easier to work with, and how documenting and naming correctly can make or break your code, i dont know if i should say that ive gone a little
overboard with documenting the sourcefile but isnt it good to be more descriptive about your code? someone else might someday be maintaining it and have no idea what youve done.


About the features :

basicly anything this program does is done whether the user wants to or no, for example loging to a file in desktop is done
automatically. Some of the features are a work in progress, im trying to make the code as clean as i can 
it doesnt look so good so far but im still trying.


About vulnerabilities : 

Only god knows how many flaws my newbie ahh code has but if you find some please let me know im not sure how the industry 
deals with reporting vulnerabilities but please just let me know. Thanks!


Thanks for reading this!! : 

About the use : I dont think this packet sniffer will be used by anyone for harm, im not even sure if its possible 
but anyway if you can dont.
