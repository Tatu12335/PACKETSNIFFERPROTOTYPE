🛡️ PacketSnifferPrototype
PacketSnifferPrototype is a C#-based network traffic analysis tool. This project was born out of a deep interest in cybersecurity and the desire to understand how data moves across networks at a fundamental level.

🚀 Why This Project?
As a developer with about a year of experience (six months specifically in the .NET ecosystem), I wanted to challenge myself beyond basic CRUD applications. I chose to build a packet sniffer to:

Explore low-level networking concepts and the OSI model.

Practice architectural refactoring (moving from "horror code" to clean, maintainable logic).

Demonstrate the capability of C# for systems-adjacent tasks.

✨ Key Features
Real-Time Capture: Monitors network traffic directly through the console.

Automated Logging: Automatically saves captured data to the desktop for later analysis.

Refactored Architecture: Recently underwent a complete rewrite to implement proper naming conventions, better readability, and industry-standard practices.

Deep Documentation: The source code is extensively documented to ensure ease of maintenance and clarity for future contributors.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: C# (.NET)

Logic:  Packet Capture integration.

Interface: CLI (Command Line Interface), with plans for a WPF or Web GUI.

🧠 The Journey & Evolution
This project is a testament to my growth as a programmer.

From Prototype to Standard: The original core logic was functional but lacked structure. I made the conscious decision to start fresh, applying Clean Code principles and separation of concerns.

The Choice of C#: While C# isn't the most "traditional" language for low-level networking, using it allowed me to show how modern, managed languages can handle complex data streams while maintaining high readability and maintainability.

Learning Outcomes: Through this build, I have mastered complex loops, advanced asynchronous programming, and the importance of descriptive documentation.

🛣️ Roadmap
[x] Core Sniffing Logic (Refactored)
